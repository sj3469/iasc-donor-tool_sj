# IASC Donor Analytics

An AI-powered donor intelligence prototype for the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture (IASC), a nonprofit research center and publisher at the University of Virginia. The tool lets a development team ask natural language questions about their donor database — "Which lapsed donors in Virginia gave more than $5,000?", "Plan a fundraising trip to NYC", "Who are our highest-potential prospects?" — and receive data-grounded, actionable answers. Claude (Anthropic) handles intent parsing and response synthesis; Python functions query a SQLite database and return structured results; a curated knowledge base of fundraising best practices is injected into the system prompt so every answer is informed by domain expertise.

> **This repository uses entirely synthetic data.** The donor database is generated procedurally by `data/generate_mock_data.py` and contains no real names, contact information, giving history, or any other actual IASC data. No real donor data has ever been committed to this repository.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd iasc-donor-tool

# Install dependencies (Python 3.11+ required)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your Anthropic API key
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and set: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Generate the mock donor database (300 synthetic records)
python data/generate_mock_data.py

# Launch the app
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Running in GitHub Codespaces (no local setup required)

1. Click the green **Code** button on the repo page, then **Codespaces > New codespace**.
2. Wait for the environment to build (about 2 minutes the first time).
3. Add your Anthropic API key as a Codespaces secret: go to github.com > Settings > Codespaces > Secrets,
   create a secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and set its value to your key. Grant it access to this repo.
4. In the Codespace terminal, run: `streamlit run src/app.py`
5. When prompted, click **Open in Browser** to view the app.

The mock database is generated automatically during environment setup.
You do not need to run `generate_mock_data.py` manually.

## Deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
2. Go to share.streamlit.io and connect your GitHub account.
3. Create a new app, pointing to `src/app.py` in your fork.
4. Under **Advanced settings > Secrets**, paste the contents of `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example`
   and replace the placeholder with your real API key.
5. Click **Deploy**. The mock database will be generated automatically on first startup.

Note: do not use real donor data with this deployment. The app has no authentication.

**To rotate the API key after initial deployment:** go to https://share.streamlit.io, find the app, click the three-dot menu (⋮) on the right > **Settings** > **Secrets**, and update the value to the new key in the format `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."`  . The app will restart automatically.

## Using the app

**Chat interface:** Type any question about donors in the chat box at the bottom of the page. Claude will call one or more data query functions, synthesize the results, and display a response with specific names, amounts, and dates from the database.

**Sample questions:** The left sidebar contains eight pre-written example queries. Click any of them to send it directly to the chat without typing.

**Sidebar stats:** The sidebar shows a live summary of the database — total contacts, active donors, lapsed donors, prospects, total lifetime giving, and average gift — so you always have context at a glance.

**Token usage:** Every assistant response displays an inline usage line below it showing the model used, number of API calls, input/output token counts, estimated cost, and latency. The sidebar accumulates session totals so you can track your spending across a full session.

**Model selection:** Use the Settings section in the sidebar to switch between Claude Sonnet (the default, recommended for production quality) and Claude Haiku (faster and cheaper, useful for development and testing).

**Clear conversation:** The "Clear conversation" button at the bottom of the sidebar resets both the chat history and the session token tracker.

```

**Key design decisions:**

- **Tool use, not RAG:** Donor data is tabular and well-structured. Claude decides which filters and operations to apply; Python executes parameterized SQL queries. This is more reliable and cheaper than embedding donor records.
- **Knowledge base injection:** Fundraising best practices and IASC-specific context are loaded as markdown and appended to the system prompt on every call. This is simple, transparent, and easy to extend.
- **Token tracking:** Every API call is timed and counted. Costs are displayed inline so users develop intuition for what different query types cost.
- **No LangChain or LlamaIndex:** The tool use loop is implemented directly with the Anthropic SDK. This is intentional — the code is easier to read, debug, and teach.

## Running tests

```bash
# Unit tests for the data query layer — no API calls, no cost
pytest tests/test_queries.py -v

# All tests except those that call the Claude API
pytest tests/ -k "not llm" -v

# Full behavioral tests: real API calls, real cost (~$0.10-0.50 total)
pytest tests/test_scenarios.py -v

# Run a single scenario by name
pytest tests/test_scenarios.py -v -k "top_donors"
```

The test suite requires `data/donors.db` to exist. If it does not, the query tests will be skipped with a clear message. The scenario tests additionally require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be set.

---

## Cost estimates

| Scenario | Approximate cost |
|---|---|
| Single query (Sonnet, with tool use) | $0.01 – $0.05 |
| Full behavioral test suite | $0.10 – $0.50 |
| Typical 30-minute session | $0.50 – $2.00 |

The system prompt (base instructions + schema summary + knowledge base) consumes approximately 3,000 – 4,000 tokens on every API call. This is the dominant cost for short queries. The knowledge base token estimate is displayed in the sidebar.

Using Haiku instead of Sonnet reduces costs by roughly 75-80% at the expense of response quality. Switch to Haiku in the sidebar for development and back to Sonnet for demos and evaluations.

## Known limitations

- **Mock data only.** The 300-record database is synthetic. Real Salesforce, MailChimp, and WealthEngine integration is out of scope for this prototype.
- **No authentication.** The Streamlit app has no login screen. Do not deploy it publicly with real donor data.
- **No data export.** Query results are displayed in the chat; there is no CSV download or report generation.
- **Wealth scores are estimates.** The mock wealth scores (1-10) approximate WealthEngine output. Real scores would come from the WealthEngine API.
- **Email engagement is approximate.** Open rates and click dates in the mock data simulate MailChimp exports. Real integration would pull live MailChimp data.
- **No persistent conversation history.** Closing and reopening the browser tab starts a fresh session.

## How to extend

**Add knowledge base content:** Drop a new `.md` file into `knowledge/` and add a load call in `src/knowledge.py` following the pattern for the existing files. Changes take effect immediately without restarting the app.

**Add a new query function:** Write the function in `src/queries.py` following the existing pattern (returns `{"results": [...], "count": int, "summary": str}`), then add a corresponding tool definition in the `TOOLS` list in `src/llm.py` and a mapping in `TOOL_FUNCTIONS`.

**Replace knowledge injection with RAG:** The `load_knowledge_base()` function in `src/knowledge.py` is the single integration point. Replace it with a retrieval function that takes the user's question and returns relevant passages; the rest of the system remains unchanged.

**Add visualizations:** `plotly` is already installed. After Claude returns a response, the relevant query result (as a dict) can be passed to a `plotly` chart and rendered with `st.plotly_chart()` in `src/app.py`.

**Connect real data:** Replace the SQLite queries in `src/queries.py` with Salesforce API calls (using `simple_salesforce`), MailChimp API calls, or WealthEngine API calls. The function signatures and return formats stay the same; only the data source changes.
