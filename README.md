# IASC Donor Analytics

An AI-powered donor intelligence prototype for the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture (IASC), a nonprofit research center and publisher at the University of Virginia. The tool lets a development team ask natural language questions about their donor database — "Which lapsed donors in Virginia gave more than $5,000?", "Plan a fundraising trip to NYC", "Who are our highest-potential prospects?" — and receive data-grounded, actionable answers. An LLM (Claude or GPT, selectable in the sidebar) handles intent parsing and response synthesis; Python functions query a SQLite database and return structured results; a curated knowledge base of fundraising best practices is injected into the system prompt so every answer is informed by domain expertise.

> **This repository uses entirely synthetic data.** The donor database is generated procedurally by `data/generate_mock_data.py` and contains no real names, contact information, giving history, or any other actual IASC data. No real donor data has ever been committed to this repository.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd iasc-donor-tool

# Install dependencies (Python 3.11+ required)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your API key(s)
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and set at least one of:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   (required for Claude models)
#   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          (required for GPT models)

# Generate the mock donor database (300 synthetic records)
python data/generate_mock_data.py

# Launch the app
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

---

## Running in GitHub Codespaces (no local setup required)

1. Click the green **Code** button on the repo page, then **Codespaces > New codespace**.
2. Wait for the environment to build (about 2 minutes the first time).
3. Add your API key(s) as Codespaces secrets: go to github.com > Settings > Codespaces > Secrets.
   Create `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (for Claude models) and/or `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for GPT models),
   and grant each secret access to this repo. You need at least one key.
4. In the Codespace terminal, run: `streamlit run src/app.py`
5. When prompted, click **Open in Browser** to view the app.

The mock database is generated automatically during environment setup.
You do not need to run `generate_mock_data.py` manually.

## Deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
2. Go to share.streamlit.io and connect your GitHub account.
3. Create a new app, pointing to `src/app.py` in your fork.
4. Under **Advanced settings > Secrets**, add your API key(s):
   ```toml
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-your-key-here"   # for Claude models
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-openai-key-here"   # for GPT models
   ```
   You need at least one. The default model is GPT-5.4 mini, so `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required
   unless you switch the default in `src/config.py`.
5. Click **Deploy**. The mock database will be generated automatically on first startup.

Note: do not use real donor data with this deployment. The app has no authentication.

**To rotate a key after initial deployment:** go to https://share.streamlit.io, find the app, click the three-dot menu (⋮) > **Settings** > **Secrets**, and update the value. The app will restart automatically.

## Using the app

**Chat interface:** Type any question about donors in the chat box at the bottom of the page. Claude will call one or more data query functions, synthesize the results, and display a response with specific names, amounts, and dates from the database.

**Sample questions:** The left sidebar contains eight pre-written example queries. Click any of them to send it directly to the chat without typing.

**Sidebar stats:** The sidebar shows a live summary of the database — total contacts, active donors, lapsed donors, prospects, total lifetime giving, and average gift — so you always have context at a glance.

**Token usage:** Every assistant response displays an inline usage line below it showing the model used, number of API calls, input/output token counts, estimated cost, and latency. The sidebar accumulates session totals so you can track your spending across a full session.

**Model selection:** Use the Settings section in the sidebar to switch between models. The default is **GPT-5.4 mini** (fast and cheap). Other options: GPT-5.4 (higher quality), Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku. GPT models require `OPENAI_API_KEY`; Claude models require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

**Clear conversation:** The "Clear conversation" button at the bottom of the sidebar resets both the chat history and the session token tracker.

**Key design decisions:**

- **Tool use, not RAG:** Donor data is tabular and well-structured. Claude decides which filters and operations to apply; Python executes parameterized SQL queries. This is more reliable and cheaper than embedding donor records.
- **Knowledge base injection:** Fundraising best practices and IASC-specific context are loaded as markdown and appended to the system prompt on every call. This is simple, transparent, and easy to extend.
- **Token tracking:** Every API call is timed and counted. Costs are displayed inline so users develop intuition for what different query types cost.
- **No LangChain or LlamaIndex:** The tool use loop is implemented directly with the Anthropic and OpenAI SDKs. This is intentional — the code is easier to read, debug, and teach. Both providers share the same tool definitions and query functions; only the API call format differs.

## Running tests

```bash
# Unit tests for the data query layer — no API calls, no cost
pytest tests/test_queries.py -v

# All tests except those that call the Claude API
pytest tests/ -k "not llm" -v

# Full behavioral tests: real API calls, real cost (~$0.10-0.50 total)
pytest tests/test_scenarios.py -v

# Run a single scenario by name
pytest tests/test_scenarios.py -v -k "top_donors"
```

The test suite requires `data/donors.db` to exist. If it does not, the query tests will be skipped with a clear message. The scenario tests additionally require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be set.

## Cost estimates

| Scenario | GPT-5.4 mini (default) | Claude Sonnet |
|---|---|---|
| Single query with tool use | ~$0.003 – $0.01 | $0.01 – $0.05 |
| Full behavioral test suite | ~$0.03 – $0.15 | $0.10 – $0.50 |
| Typical 30-minute session | ~$0.10 – $0.50 | $0.50 – $2.00 |

The system prompt (base instructions + schema summary + knowledge base) consumes approximately 3,000 – 4,000 tokens on every API call. This is the dominant cost for short queries. The knowledge base token estimate is displayed in the sidebar.

GPT-5.4 mini ($0.75/$4.50 per MTok in/out) is the default and cheapest option. GPT-5.4 ($2.50/$15.00) offers higher quality at moderate cost. Claude Sonnet ($3.00/$15.00) is comparable to GPT-5.4. Claude Haiku ($0.80/$4.00) is the cheapest Claude option. Every response shows the exact cost in the inline usage line.

## Known limitations

- **Mock data only.** The 300-record database is synthetic. Real Salesforce, MailChimp, and WealthEngine integration is out of scope for this prototype.
- **No authentication.** The Streamlit app has no login screen. Do not deploy it publicly with real donor data.
- **No data export.** Query results are displayed in the chat; there is no CSV download or report generation.
- **Wealth scores are estimates.** The mock wealth scores (1-10) approximate WealthEngine output. Real scores would come from the WealthEngine API.
- **Email engagement is approximate.** Open rates and click dates in the mock data simulate MailChimp exports. Real integration would pull live MailChimp data.
- **No persistent conversation history.** Closing and reopening the browser tab starts a fresh session.

## How to extend

**Add knowledge base content:** Drop a new `.md` file into `knowledge/` and add a load call in `src/knowledge.py` following the pattern for the existing files. Changes take effect immediately without restarting the app.

**Add a new query function:** Write the function in `src/queries.py` following the existing pattern (returns `{"results": [...], "count": int, "summary": str}`), then add a corresponding tool definition in the `TOOLS` list in `src/llm.py` and a mapping in `TOOL_FUNCTIONS`.

**Replace knowledge injection with RAG:** The `load_knowledge_base()` function in `src/knowledge.py` is the single integration point. Replace it with a retrieval function that takes the user's question and returns relevant passages; the rest of the system remains unchanged.

**Add visualizations:** `plotly` is already installed. After Claude returns a response, the relevant query result (as a dict) can be passed to a `plotly` chart and rendered with `st.plotly_chart()` in `src/app.py`.

**Connect real data:** Replace the SQLite queries in `src/queries.py` with Salesforce API calls (using `simple_salesforce`), MailChimp API calls, or WealthEngine API calls. The function signatures and return formats stay the same; only the data source changes.
